    <h1>Lobster Roll Khachapuri</h1>
    <img src="../images/lobsterroll.webp" alt="Two delicious looking lobster rolls."/>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lobster roll khachapuri fuses two of the greatest sandwiches ever. The buttery New England lobster roll meets golden-baked Georgian cheese-stuffed flatbread with stunning results. If possible, start these the day before you plan to bake them, because the homemade dough really benefits from an overnight fermentation.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Lobster Filling</li>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) lobster tails</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon, plus more for garnish (optional)</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay®</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper or smoked paprika, plus more for garnish (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Egg Wash</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For dough, add warm water to the bowl of a stand mixer, and sprinkle yeast over the top. Let sit for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk sugar, egg, and melted butter into the bowl. Add flour and salt, and knead using a dough hook until a very soft, sticky, relatively elastic dough is formed, about 5 minutes, scraping the sides down occasionally if necessary.</li>
        <li>Remove from the mixer and use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Cover and let dough rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2  hours.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a work surface, and scrape dough out onto the surface. Lightly flour your hands; form dough into a smooth ball, using a bench scraper to assist if necessary. Transfer dough into an oiled resealable plastic bag. Squeeze out most of the air and seal tightly. Place in the refrigerator overnight before using.</li>
        <li>For filling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
        <li>Place lobster tails on the prepared baking sheet and cut each lobster tail down the center with scissors. Spread open the shell to expose the meat and remove the digestive tract if necessary. Grab lobster meat from the thick end, and peel towards the tail, to separate meat from the shell. Lay meat back into the shell in its original position.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meat has just turned opaque and lightly firm, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely, about 20 minutes, and then dice into 1/4-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Transfer lobster meat into a bowl. Add tarragon, lemon zest, Old Bay seasoning, cayenne, and mayonnaise. Mix until thoroughly combined, cover, and refrigerate until needed. Turn the oven off if not proceeding immediately.</li>
        <li>For khachapuri, place chilled dough on a lightly floured surface, and divide into 4 equal portions. Form each portion into a ball, and use a rolling pin to roll each dough into a circle about 9 inches across.</li>
        <li>Divide filling into 4 equal portions. For each circle of dough, transfer about 1/3 of the filling portion in a ring pattern about 1 inch away from the edge. Sprinkle Monterey Jack cheese over the whole dough circle, except for a 1-inch border around the edge.</li>
        <li>Roll 2 opposite edges of dough towards the center, until the rolled sides about 1 1/2 inches apart in the middle. Twist the ends together to seal the dough, and twist into 2 points, to create a boat shape.</li>
        <li>Transfer khachapuri to silpat or parchment-lined baking sheets. You should be able to fit 2 per pan. Set the rest of the lobster filling evenly into the centers of each “boat.” Spread filling out to fill the space but dont pack down.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg and water together in a small bowl; paint exposed dough with egg wash. Top evenly with remaining cheese. If desired, sprinkle with paprika or cayenne.</li>
        <li>Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned, 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer onto a cooling rack; let cool for about 10 to 15 minutes before serving. Garnish with additional paprika or cayenne and chopped fresh tarragon.</li>
    </ol>
